# Hello! üëã

Here I would like to share with you this code I am working on. Let me know if you have any problems.

Abre el proyecto con Binder -> 

--

**Issue 1**

Absolute path 

--

**Issue 2**

Package version of `tidyr 0.8.3` does not include `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` functions added in `tidyr version 1.0.0`

Use `sessionInfo()` to check this

# Reproducible environments 


---

## There are several tools to capture computational environments

**Capture only the software and its versions used in an environment**

* Package management systems (üì¶`packrat` -üì¶ `renv`)

* Binder

**replicate an entire computational environment including the operating system and customised settings**

* Virtual machines 

* Containers

# Package management systems

**`renv` package**

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/renv.png")
```
.footnote[[Reproducible Environments - RStudio](https://environments.rstudio.com/)]
---

# `renv` package

1. üèÅ `renv::init()` works by creating a new library. A library stores installed packages.

--
2. üì¶ Install the packages *

--

3. üì∏ `renv::snapshot()` creates a new file in your project titled `renv.lock`. The file contains all the information you need to communicate your project‚Äôs dependencies at the moment you call snapshot. 

--
4. üå± `renv::restore()` recreates the environment!

# Binder

Binder is a service which generates fully-functioning versions of projects from a git repository and serves them on the cloud. These ‚Äúbinderized‚Äù projects can be accessed and interacted with by others via a web browser. 


```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/binderlogo.png")
```

.pull-left[
## Advantages

- Easy to use

- You can access the infomation with one click

- It is free
]
.pull-right[
## Limitations

- Computational power

- Security/privacy (using `mybinder.org` BinderHub)

- Also no FTP for connecting to some data.
]

# What is a BinderHub?


```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/siberia.jpg")
```


.footnote[[The Turing Way - BinderHub](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/binderhub.html?highlight=mybinder%20org)]

---

# mybinder.org 

A free, public BinderHub. Because it is public, you should not use it if your project requires personal or confidential information (such as passwords).

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mybinder.png")
```

## "Binderizing" your project üåÄ

1. Specify the computational environment

‚ûïüìÑ **intall.R** 

‚ûïüìÑ **runtime.txt** )

--

2. Upload the project files to a publicly available repository hosting service, such as **GitHub / GitLab**

--

3. "Binderize" the project (**mybinder.org**) ‚è≥ 

--

4. Use the correct URL üîó

---

# ‚ûïüìÑ `runtime.txt`

> Specify the R and package versions used

For this you must choose a date where the versions of your packages are captured in MRAN.


**`r-version-<YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>`**

---

# ‚ûïüìÑ `runtime.txt`


```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
r-3.6-2020-08-20 #r-version-<YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>
```

## ‚ûïüìÑ `install.R`  

> This file should have listed all of the packages to be installed 

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("shiny")
```

# What is MRAN? üì∑

Since September 17th, 2014, the checkpoint server has been taking a daily snapshot üì∏ at precisely midnight UTC of the entire CRAN repository and storing it on [Microsoft R Archived Network (MRAN)](https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/reproducibility#reproducibility).  

These snapshots have been available to the R community ever since.


--
> ‚ö† Non-CRAN packages, such as those available on GitHub, are not part of the snapshot process.
--

.footnote[[MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/)]

---

# `checkpoint` package

‚è±  E`checkpoint` packagea llows you to install packages as they existed on CRAN on a specific snapshot date as if you had a CRAN time machine.


```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(checkpoint)
checkpoint("YYYY-MM-DD") 
```


.footnote[[`checkpoint` package](https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/reproducibility#checkpointpkg)]
---

# 2. Upload your code to the repository


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("repo_entorno.png")
```



---

# 3. "Binderize" your project üåÄ

a. Go to https://mybinder.org

--

b. Paste the repository URL 
`https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository>`

--

c. Finally, click the `Launch` button.

# RStudio IDE URL  üíª

You should call the binderized project using this template link

`https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/<user>/<repository>/<branch>?urlpath?rstudio`

Example üîó:
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/flor14/test_shiny/master?urlpath=shiny/test/


.footnote[[Ejemplos en el repositorio de Binder](https://github.com/binder-examples/r)]

# Shiny app URL  ‚ú®

You should call the binderized project using this template link

`https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/<user>/<repository>/<branch>?urlpath=shiny/<folder>/`

Example üîó:
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/flor14/test_shiny/master?urlpath=shiny/test/

# Practice üí™

# Going back to the first example

* `tidyr` 1.0.0 * Included` pivot_longer () `and` pivot_wider () `

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidyr.png")
```

# Exercise

Starting from a fork of my repository:

Could you modify the code from the first exercise to make it work?
